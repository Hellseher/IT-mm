_FreeMind ready maps_

__9152 ../mms/__

This repository contains mind maps (mm) of my IT-CS (Information Technology -  
Computer Science) self education. It could be helpfully for beginners  
to start exploring the world of IT.  

I am concentrated on _"GNU/Linux side"_ of IT world, and the most comprehensive  
mm is operating system's (os.mm). It includes hierarchy mm of os history and
GNU/Linux  distribution derivatives. 

Every mm includes credits, links and references.
